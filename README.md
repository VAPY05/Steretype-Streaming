## üìí Description
Stereotype Streaming is a project that I am creating with passion as Project Defense for [ReactJS](https://softuni.bg/trainings/3727/reactjs-june-2022) course at [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/). The idea was born in early 2020, but the work started at the beginning of the course. The project represents the skills that I acquired in the module [JS-Web](https://softuni.bg/modules/122/js-web/1307) such as routing with React Router V6, creating components, creating and manipulating controlled forms, keeping state and using hooks. I wrote the entire Back-End server with ExpressJS and MongoDB and of course the Front-End with ReactJS and other libraries.

</p>

The application is devided into 4 main modules:
### 1. App.js
  The entry point of the application. It initializes the firebase backend - firebase auth and firestore database, imports dependecies and middlewares, initializes page router, registers routes and starts the application.
### 2. Components
  Modules handling the html structure and templates, render logic, stylization and overall presentation.
### 3. Services 
  Modules realizing the connection with the database and the different collections in it, ordering sorting and queries structure, CRUD operations, authentication.

## üß± Architecture for the Back-End

The Server is also called SWS(Stereotype Web Server)
